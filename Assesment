def display_pattern():         #The def display_pattern(): line is used to define a function in Python. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

                               # def: This keyword is used to define a new function.
                               # display_pattern: This is the name of the function. You can choose any valid name for your function.
                               # (): These parentheses indicate that this function does not take any arguments.
                               # :: This colon signifies the start of the function's body.
    # Define the number of lines in the pattern
    lines = 7

    # Loop to print each line
    for i in range(lines):
        # Print spaces to align the asterisk diagonally in the mirror pattern
        print(' ' * (2 * (lines - i - 1)) + '*')

# Call the function to display the pattern
display_pattern()
